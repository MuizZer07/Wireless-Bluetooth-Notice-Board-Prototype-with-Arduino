# Wireless-Bluetooth-Notice-Board-Prototype-with-Arduino
This is an Electronic Wireless Notice Board project. We have made a prototype with an Arduino Uno Board. It has a Bluetooth Module that can be connected via a smart phone. User can send text from his/her smart phone with a simple application to show it on the display. In this case, the Bluetooth module that we used (HC-05) has an open source free android application (Bluetooth Terminal HD-05) to send serial input (text) to the Arduino board. We received the serial input and showed on a 16x2 LCD Display. It can display at most 32 characters. For a prototype, we used a smaller and simpler display to reduce the cost and complexity. We used a loop to show the outputs iteratively and it continues to show the outputs until the user wants it to stop. By giving a single character input “x”, the output iteration will stop and the display will be cleared. If then the user gives more input, it starts iterating again. Every new input will add at the end of the loop. So, the display will continue to show the inputs that user gives one by one.
